INSTALL HOWTO
=============

All you need to install any of the Indicators and, or Strategies
contained in this repository is just copy <whatever>.java files to your
$HOME/JForex/Indicators and, or $HOME/JForex/Strategies respectively.

Open the indicator or strategy in your Dukascopy/JForex platform and
compile it; the platform will auto recompile updated strategies, but
indicators must/should be recompiled manually.

After that, you must use GNU make to sync between your updates and, or
changes from this source directory.
